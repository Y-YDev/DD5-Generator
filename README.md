# DD5 Generator

/!\ _This application is currently under development._

This application is a treasure generation tool for Dungeon and Dragon 5th edition.  
It sets up a nestJs server that generates treasures on port 3000.

Treasure generation is based on the following website: https://5e-drs.fr/les-tresors/

The general drop table has not yet been implemented and some ranks magic objects are missing.

The file folder contains the generation tables used by the app (taken from the site and formatted)

## How to run

Go to "dd5-geneator" (`cd .\dd5-generator\`)  
run `npm run start`  
open `http://localhost:3000/`, refresh to rethrow treasures generation.
