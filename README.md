# DD5 Generator

/!\ _This application is currently under development._

This application is a treasure generation tool for Dungeon and Dragon 5th edition.  
It sets up a nestJs server that generates treasures on port 3000.

Treasure generation is based on the following website: https://5e-drs.fr/les-tresors/

The general drop table has not yet been implemented and only the rank 1 and 2 magic objects have been made.

The file folder contains the generation tables used by the app (taken from the site and formatted)

## How to run

Go to "dd5-geneator" (`cd .\dd5-generator\`)  
run `npm run start`  
open `http://localhost:3000/`, refresh to rethrow treasures generation.
